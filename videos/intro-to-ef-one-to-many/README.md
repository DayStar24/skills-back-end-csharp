In this video and others, we use Powershell to run migration commands. As of mid-2017, these migration command-line tools are only compatible with the cmd.exe command prompt, and *not* Powershell. Thus, whenever we type `powershell` in the location bar, you should instead type `cmd` to open the proper command line tools.

## Code

We start this lesson with the code in the `video-one2many-start` branch of the CheeseMVC repo: [starting code](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/CheeseMVC/tree/video-one2many-start)

You'll create the code for the end of the lesson yourself as part of an in-class studio!
