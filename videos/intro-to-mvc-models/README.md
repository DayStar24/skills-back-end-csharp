## Notes

In this lesson we will focus on creating distinct, POCO model objects. POCO stands for "plain, old C# object". We will then refactor and move all data operations out of the controller layer and into the model layer. We will use model binding to auto-create model classes on form submission.

Use the starting code in the **Code** section below to ensure your code matches the starting place for this video lesson and then code along with the video. And note that this video is 52 minutes long, so if you want to tackle it in smaller chunks, just note where you leave off each time.



## Code

We start this lesson with the code in the `video-models-start` branch of the CheeseMVC repo: [starting code](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/CheeseMVC/tree/video-models-start)

We end this lesson with the code in the `video-models-end` branch of the CheeseMVC repo: [ending code](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/CheeseMVC/tree/video-models-end)
