## Errata

In the video it is stated that `using` statements are not allowed in Razor templates. This is not correct. You may add such statements using the following syntax.

```nohighlight
@using CheeseMVC.Models
@model List<Cheese>
```

This has the same effect as the following `@model` declaration, which was used in the video.

```nohighlight
@model List<CheeseMVC.Models.Cheese>
```

## Code

We start this lesson with the code in the `video-viewmodels-start` branch of the CheeseMVC repo: [starting code](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/CheeseMVC/tree/video-viewmodels-start)

We end this lesson with the code in the `video-viewmodels-end` branch of the CheeseMVC repo: [ending code](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/CheeseMVC/tree/video-viewmodels-end)
