In this video and others, we use Powershell to run migration commands. As of mid-2017, these migration command-line tools are only compatible with the cmd.exe command prompt, and *not* Powershell. Thus, whenever we type `powershell` in the location bar, you should instead type `cmd` to open the proper command line tools.
