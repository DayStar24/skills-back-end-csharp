Work on these exercises in the `csharp-exercises` solution, creating a new project for each. You may name the projects whatever you like, but use proper [C# naming conventions](../../csharp4python/naming-conventions/).

1. **Lists**:  Write a static method to find the sum of all the even numbers in a list. Within `Main`, create a list with at least 10 integers and call your method on the list.
2. **Lists and Strings**: Write a static method to print out each word in a list that has exactly 5 letters.
3. **Arrays**: Create and initialize in a single line an array with the following values: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. Then loop through the array and print out each value.
3. **Dictionaries**: Make a program similar to `GradebookDict`, but which takes in students names and ID numbers (as integers) instead of names and grades. In this case, however, the keys should be integers (the IDs) and the values should be strings (the names). Modify the roster printing code accordingly.
4. **Strings**: In one of the Gradebook programs (it doesn't matter which), modify the code that prints out the class roster near the end of the program to use the [`StringBuilder` class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2839d5h5(v=vs.110).aspx).
