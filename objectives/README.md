* Create an `Array`, `List`, and `Dictionary`
* Utilize `List` and `Dictionary` methods and properties
* Iterate through lists and dictionaries
* Format strings and escape characters
* Use the `StringBuilder` class
* Demonstrate basic working knowledge of Visual Studio IDE, including use of the debugger

### Class 3

* Describe what filters in ASP.NET Core MVC do
* Explain the characteristics of each component of MVC
* Create a new Web Application project in Visual Studio
* Create new controllers and action methods
* Explain why you have to pass another argument to render HTML when you use `return Content()`
* Describe the default routing behavior and how you can customize it with `[Route("..")]`
* Explain when and why you would want to use `[HttpGet]` and `[HttpPost]`
* Handle GET requests that have query parameters
* Handle GET requests that pass parameters via URL segments
* Access POST parameters
* Redirect users

### Class 4

* Explain how the `View()` method works
* Explain what it means to say that Core MVC is a "convention over configuration" approach.
* Create a new Views folder
* Create a new Razor template
* Describe what is provided by the `_Layout.cshtml` file
* Utilize C# code in a template
* Use the `asp-controller` and `asp-action` attributes
* Use the `ViewBag` class

### Class 5

* Define encapsulation and explain how it results in better code
* Explain the relationship between a class and an object
* Properly use the `this` keyword
* Explain and properly use access modifiers
- Explain why fields should almost always be `private`
* Describe what accessors (getters and setters) are and why they are useful
* Explain what a property is and what code is created by the compiler when you create an auto-implemented property
* Describe what a constructor is and how you can identify it
* Create overloaded constructors
* Use `this()` to invoke one constructor from within another in the same class
* Utilize static fields and properties (and explain when you would want to)
* Explain what constants are and how to declare them (and what naming convention to use)


### Class 6

- Define and call instance methods of an object
- Define and call static methods
- Explain why instance variables may not be referenced within static methods
- Write a custom `ToString` method for a given class
- Explain the concepts of object identity and equality, and how they differ
- Explain the use of `Equals` to determine when two objects are equal
- Explain the behavior of `==` with respect to objects in C#
- Use the Single Responsibility Principle to create small, well-designed classes
- Describe and implement the best practices for implementing `Equals` within a class
- Explain when `GetHashCode` should be implemented within a class
- Use the `GetType` method to determine the class of an object
- Use Visual Studio's shortcuts to generate well-structured `Equals` and `GetHashCode` methods

### Class 7

- Define inheritance and explain how it works in C#
- Use `:` to allow one class to inherit from another
- Explain which fields and methods are inherited by a class extension, based on C#'s rules and taking into account access modifiers
- Call a parent class constructor from a child class constructor using `base`
- Override methods when extending a class (and declare which methods can be overridden using `virtual`)
- Describe the role of the `Object` class in each class' hierarchy
- Describe and use abstract classes and abstract methods
- Explain how variable and parameter declaration relates to inheritance (i.e. how inheritance enables polymorphic behavior)
- Use basic class diagrams to visualize and design class relationships

### Class 8

* Write LINQ queries and methods
* Explain how the `var` keyword works
* Explain what a *lambda* function is and how you would use it in a LINQ method
* Define what a *POCO* is
* Describe what the *Model* part of MVC is used for
* Differentiate between what kind of functionality should be handled by the Model versus the Controller
* Explain what *refactoring* is
* Describe what model binding does, what its benefits are, and how to use it
* Describe how to use a unique identifier in a class (as we did when we solved the "remove" functionality problem)
* Explain why the names of the class fields must match the names of the form fields for model binding to work

### Class 9

* Describe how ViewModels work and why you would want to use them
* Use tag helpers, such as `asp-for` and `asp-validation-for` in your view to utilize the ViewModel
* Explain how you can use ViewModels to help add a layer of validation
* Use the `[Required]` attribute
* Display error messages in the view
* Explain what *enum types* are and when you would want to use them
* Use an enum type and then represent that data in a `<select>` element.

### Class 10

- Explain how to throw an exception
- Describe the practices to avoid when throwing an exception
- Explain what purposes the `StackTrace` and `Message` properties of exceptions serve
- Describe how to use the three exception handler components: the `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks
- Explain how to use the `InnerException` property
- Create your own custom exception classes
- Describe some of the exceptions that .NET's CLR automatically throws (e.g., `Arithmetic Exception`, `InvalidCastException`, `StackOverflowException`)
